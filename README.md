# Python Exam
This repository contains code to analyze strings of DNA and determine the linguistic complexity (how many observed substrings there are compared to the possible substrings there are) for each substring length

### Instructions
There are 3 different functions in this script. The first one gives the observed number of substrings, the second one gives teh possible number of substrings, and the third calculates the linguistic complexity.

To use these functions, you must first clone the repository.

To use on the command line, make sure you are in the folder with the script, then type "python python_exam.py" followed by the DNA string you would like to analyze and the substring length you would like to use

Example:
    python python_exam.py ATGTCTGTCTGTA 2

This will return all 3 functions; function 1 on the top, function 2 in the middle, and function 3 on the bottom
